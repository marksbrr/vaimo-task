In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run install` + `npm start`

* In hindisight, I would have used redux toolkit for this project, but late realisation and deadline approaching upheld me
from doing so. Overall, the task seemed a lot easier than it actually turned out to be. Still learned a few tricks whilst
making this project come alive. Hopefully you see good things within my work and I would be happy to receive some criticism!

Kind regards, Marks.
